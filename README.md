init.el
=======

My emacs init files.


Currently, there are the following files:


smart-kill-line.el

Kill line include the newline if currently at beginning of line. Otherwise kill-line.

jump-brackets.el

Jump to the corresponding (open/close) bracket if at a close/open bracket,
   otherwise to nearest open bracket on the same level in terms of brackets.
